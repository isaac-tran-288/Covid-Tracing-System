Place individual components into this folder example below:

components
    |-> utils
        | -> helper functions used for formatting
    |-> newcomponent //new folder created for the component
        |-> index.js //this is where you place your code (see below)
        |-> style.css //this is where you style this specific index.js



index.js example code

import React from "react"; //needed for using react
import "./style.css"; //importing the style guide from the same folder

function newComponent() { //name the component the same as the folder name
    return (
        <div>
            html code
        <div>
    )
};

export default newComponent; //exports this 'function' so it can be imported by another file
